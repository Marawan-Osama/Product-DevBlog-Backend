# Product-DevBlog-Backend

Fully functional back-end api for jobs that contain products. Each product contains an update and each update has update points.
There are users and each user has control and ownership over their own products and can only edit their own. They can see all others if they wish.

This project was created using Typescript, Express.JS and Prisma for PostGres ORM database control.

To run just use npm i and then npm start
